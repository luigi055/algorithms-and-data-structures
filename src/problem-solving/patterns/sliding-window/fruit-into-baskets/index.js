// Given an array of characters where each character represents a
// fruit tree, you are given two baskets, and your goal is to put
// maximum number of fruits in each basket. The only restriction is
// that each basket can have only one type of fruit.

// You can start with any tree, but you canâ€™t skip a tree once you have
// started. You will pick one fruit from each tree until you cannot, i.e.,
// you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.

// Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both baskets.

// Signature:
// fruitIntoBaskets :: char[] -> number
// Time Complexity = O(N + N) => O(N)
// Space Complexity = O(1) Since can be a maximum of three types of fruits stored in the frequency counter;
