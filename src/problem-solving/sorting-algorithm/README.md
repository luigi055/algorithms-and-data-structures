# Sorting Algorithm

It's used to rearrange a given array or list of elements according to a comparison operator on the elements. the comparison operator is used to decide the new order of element in the respective data structure.


## What is sorting?

Sorting is the process of rearranging the items in a collection (e.g. an Array) so that the items are in some kind of order.

## Bubble sort, selection sort and insertion sort
  They don't scale well.
  Try out bubble sort on an array of 100000 elements, it will take quite some time!

## Faster sorts
There is a family of sorting algorithms that can improve complexity from O(n^2) to O(n log n).
  example:
    quick sort
    merge sort
    radix sort
