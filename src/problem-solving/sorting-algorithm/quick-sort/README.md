# Quick Sort Summary

QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot. There are many different versions of quickSort that pick pivot in different ways.

- Always pick first element as pivot. (as implemented in this project)
- Always pick last element as pivot
- Pick a random element as pivot.
- Pick median as pivot.

The key process in quickSort is partition(). Target of partitions is, given an array and an element x of array as pivot, put x at its correct position in sorted array and put all smaller elements (smaller than x) before x, and put all greater elements (greater than x) after x. All this should be done in linear time.

## Algorithm

```
_# choose pivot_
swap a[1,rand(1,n)]

_# 2-way partition_
k = 1
for i = 2:n, if a[i] < a[1], swap a[++k,i]
swap a[1,k]
_â†’ invariant: a[1..k-1] < a[k] <= a[k+1..n]_

_# recursive sorts_
sort a[1..k-1]
sort a[k+1,n]
```

## Big-O Complexity

|                 | Time Complexity |                 |  Space Complexity  |
| :-------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: | :----------------: |
|       Best      |     average     |       Worst     |        Worst       |
|    O(n log(n))  |    O(n log(n))  |       O(n^2)    |        O(log(n))   |

### Why the worst case is quadratic time?
the worst case comes when the array or list is almost sorted or completely sorted it has to decompose each element and compare them per decomposition

O(n) decomposition * Q(n) comparisons per decomposition
