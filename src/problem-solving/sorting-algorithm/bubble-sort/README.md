# Bubble Sort

A sorting algorithm where the largest values bubble up to the top.

Bubble sort has many of the same properties as insertion sort, but has slightly higher overhead. In the case of nearly sorted data, bubble sort takes O(n) time, but requires at least 2 passes through the data (whereas insertion sort requires something more like 1 pass).

## Algorithm

```
for i = 1:n,
    swapped = false
    for j = n:i+1,
        if a[j] < a[j-1],
            swap a[j,j-1]
            swapped = true
    â†’ invariant: a[1..i] in final position
    break if not swapped
end
```
