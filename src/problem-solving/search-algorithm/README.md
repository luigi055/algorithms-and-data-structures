# Searching Algorithm

Designed to check for an element or retrieve an element from any data structure where it is sorted. Based on the type of search operation, there algorithms are clssified into two categories.

1. Sequential Search: In this, the list or array is traversed sequentially and every element is checked.

For example: Linear Search.

2. Interval Search: These algorithm are specifically designedfor searching in sorted data structures. These types of searching algorithm are much more efficient than Sequential Search as they repeatedly target the center of the search structure and divide the search in half.

For example: Binary Search.

## Types of Searching Algorithm

- Linear Search.
- Binary Search.
- Jump Search.
- Interpolation Search.
- Exponential Search.
- Sublist Search (Search a Linked List in another List).
- Fibonacci Search.
- The Ubiquitous Binary Search.
- Recursive Program to linearly search.
- Recursive function to do substring search.
- unbounded binary search.
