# Data Structures:

## What do they do?

Data structures are collections of values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied effectively to the data.

## why are there so many?

Different data structures excel at different things. Some are highly specialized, while others (like arrays or object in Javascript) are more generally used.

## List of data structures:

- Array.
- Linked List.
  - Singly Linked List.
  - Doubly Linked Lits.
- Stacks.
- Queues.
- Trees.
  - Binary SearchTrees
  - Tree Traversal
- Binary Heaps.
- Hash Tables
- Graphs
- Graph Traversal

## Why Care?

The more time you spend as a developer, the more likely you'll need to use one of these data structures.

**You've already worked with many of them unknowingly.**

**####INTERVIEWS**

#### There is no **BEST** Data Structure

They all excel in different situations.

## Example when to implement certain data structure:

- Working with map/location data. **Use Graph**
- Need an ordered list with fast inserts/removals at the beginning and end. **Use Linked List**
- Web scraping nested HTML. **use a Tree**
- Need to write a scheduler. **use a binary Heap**
