# Linked List.

## What is it?

It's a data structure that contains a **head**, **tail** and **length** property.

Linked lists of nodes, and each **node** has a **value** and a **pointer** to another node or null

## Comparisons with Arrays:

### List

- Do not have indexes!
- Connected via nodes with a next pointer.
- Random access is not allowed

### Arrays

- Indexed in order!
- Insertion and deletion can be expensive.
- Can quickly be accessed at a specific index.
