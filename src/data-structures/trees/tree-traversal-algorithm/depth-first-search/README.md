# Depth-First Search

Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

## there are three types of Depth-First Search:

- Pre Order: Traverse the tree or Graph from top to bottom
- Post Order: Traverse the tree or Graph from bottom to top
- In Order: Traverse the tree or Graph and return an ordered list;
