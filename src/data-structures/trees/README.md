# What is a tree?

In computer science, a tree is a widely used abstract data type (ADT)—or data structure implementing this ADT—that simulates a hierarchical tree structure, with a root value and subtrees of children with a parent node, represented as a set of linked nodes.

A tree data structure can be defined recursively (locally) as a collection of nodes (starting at a root node), where each node is a data structure consisting of a value, together with a list of references to nodes (the "children"), with the constraints that no reference is duplicated, and none points to the root

## Differences between lists and trees.

Lists **are Linear**, trees for the other side **are not linear**

## Rules

- A tree should have only one root node
- each child should not have relation of its sibling

## Tree Terminology

- **Root** - The top node in a tree.
- **Child** - A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the Root.
- **Parent** - The converse notion of a child.
- **Sibling** - A group of nodes with the same parent.
- **Leaf** - A node with no children.
- **Edge** - The connection between one node and another.

## Uses for Trees
