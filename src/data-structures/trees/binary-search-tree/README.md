# Binary Search Trees.

BST are special case of a Binary tree which is a type of a tree.
so, they're tree that have at most two children per node, And on top of that binary search trees are sorted in a particular way they are kept in an order.

BST are used to store data that can be compared, that is sortable so often classically we're talking about numbers and that's what we'll be working with.

the child that is smaller than the root node is putted at the left side and the larger is placed to the right.

To recap.

- Every parent node has at most **Two** children.
- Every node to the left of a parent node is **always less** than the parent.
- Every node to the right of a parent node is **always greater** than the parent.
