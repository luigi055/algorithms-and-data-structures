## Max Binary Heap

- Each Parent has at most two child nodes.
- The value of each parent node ise **always** greater then its child nodes.
- In a max Binary Heap the parent is greater than the children, but there are no guarantees between sibling nodes.
- a binary heap is as compact as possible. All the children of each node are as full as they can be and left children are filled out first
